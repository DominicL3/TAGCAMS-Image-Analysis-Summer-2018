# OSIRIS-REx TAGCAMS Image Analysis

This code is used to analyze the point spread function (PSF) and modulation transfer function (MTF) of images sent back by NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft. These images consist of a dataset from 6 months after launch (L+6Months) and from 18 months after launch (L+18 Months).
## Getting Started

* analyze_datasets.py : Main file using osiris18month.py and tagcams.py functions to perform PSF and MTF assessment between L+6Month and L+18 Month data.

* osiris18month.py : Functions used to analyze L+18Month dataset

* tagcams.py : Functions used to analyze L+6Month dataset
